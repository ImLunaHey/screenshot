# Contributing to Studio

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/fish-lgbt/studio/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fish-lgbt/studio/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## Small Pull Requests Are Welcome

We understand that not every contribution has to be a massive feature addition or a complex bug fix. Small pull requests, such as those fixing typos, improving documentation, or optimizing existing features, are just as important to the project. Here are a few things to keep in mind for smaller contributions:

- **Every bit helps**: No matter the size of the contribution, it helps improve Studio. Small improvements can significantly enhance the project's quality over time.
- **Avoid disrupting the main branch**: While we welcome all contributions, please ensure that your changes, no matter how small, do not negatively affect the project's stability. If you're unsure, feel free to discuss it in your pull request or with a maintainer.
- **Incremental improvements**: Small, incremental improvements are often easier for maintainers to review and merge faster. This approach also reduces the likelihood of conflicts with the project's main branch.

By focusing on making continuous, incremental improvements, we can collectively ensure that Studio remains a high-quality, robust tool for everyone. Don't hesitate to submit your small pull requests; they are an essential part of the project's development.
